Software required:
Python 
If you don’t already have a copy of Python installed on your computer, you will need to open up your Internet browser and go to the Python download page (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Installing python:
Once you have downloaded the Python MSI, simply navigate to the download location on your computer, double clicking the file and pressing Run when the dialog box pops up. If you want to change the install location, feel free to do so; however, it is best to leave it as is and simply select next. Scroll down in the window and find the “Add Python.exe to Path” and click on the small red “x.” Choose the “Will be installed on local hard drive” option then press “Next.” You will notice that the installation will bring up a command prompt window while Python downloads and installs “Pip.” Pip is just a package management tool. This will allow you to install all the additional Python packages that are available for download through PyPI (Python Package Index). Now that you have completed the installation process, click on “Finish.”

How to run application:
After downloading all the files, just double-click on Project1.py.It will open up application.
